    "The `load_files_and_split_into_chunks` function is a powerful tool for indexing and processing documents. It is designed to streamline the initial steps of loading files, splitting them into manageable chunks, and preparing your documents for further processing and conversion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are its key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-Format Support**: The function can process documents in different formats (PDFs, Word documents, images, etc.) from various sources (blob storage, URLs, local paths). You can pass a list of file paths, each possibly in a different format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automated File Loading**: The function efficiently loads files into memory, eliminating the need for manual file handling. It manages the reading and processing of each file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advanced Text Splitting**: After loading, the function splits the text into manageable chunks, crucial for processing large documents. You can customize the chunk size and overlap according to your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Versatile Splitting Options**: You can choose from various splitters - 'by_title', 'by_character_recursive', 'by_character_brute_force' - to fit your specific text processing requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encoding Capabilities**: The function can optionally use an encoder during splitting. This feature is particularly useful for certain text analysis tasks. You can specify the model used for encoding (default is \"gpt-4\").\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OCR Capabilities**: If the 'ocr' parameter is set to True, the function will use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) via Azure Document Intelligence to extract text from images or scanned documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Verbose Logging**: You can enable detailed logging for in-depth progress tracking and easier debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High Customizability**: The function's behavior can be tailored to your needs with additional keyword arguments. This includes options like retaining separators in chunks, using separators as regex patterns, and more."
