    "1. **Collect Queries and Relevant Documents**:\n",
    "   - Gather a set of queries (questions) that you expect users to ask.\n",
    "   - For each query, determine which documents (texts or chunks) should be retrieved and assign a relevance score (higher means more relevant).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate Run Data**:\n",
    "   - Run your retrieval system on the same set of queries.\n",
    "   - Capture the documents retrieved by your system along with their scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluate**:\n",
    "   - Use the evaluation function to compare your system's output (run data) against the ground truth (qrels).\n",
    "   - Choose appropriate metrics (like nDCG, MRR, Precision, Recall, F1) based on your evaluation needs.\n",

    "### Vector Similarity Search Using a Vectorizable Text Query\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector similarity search is a technique used to find items that are similar to a given query based on their vector representations. In this context, a vectorizable text query is transformed into a vector using techniques such as word embeddings or sentence embeddings. The search process involves comparing the query vector with the vectors of other items in the dataset to find the most similar ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works:\n",
    "1. **Vectorization**: The text query is converted into a numerical vector using embedding techniques.\n",
    "2. **Similarity Measurement**: The similarity between the query vector and the vectors of other items is measured using metrics such as cosine similarity.\n",
    "3. **Retrieval**: Items with the highest similarity scores are retrieved as the most relevant results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Azure AI Search Specifics:\n",
    "This method also uses the `@search.score` parameter but employs the HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) algorithm for scoring. The HNSW algorithm is an efficient method for nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces. The scoring range is:\n",
    "- **Cosine Similarity**: 0.333 - 1.00\n",
    "- **Euclidean and DotProduct Similarities**: 0 to 1"
